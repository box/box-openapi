description: |-
  Searches for files, folders, web links, and shared files across the
  users content or across the entire enterprise.

parameters:
  - name: query
    description: |-
      The string to search for. This query is matched against item names,
      descriptions, text content of files, and various other fields of
      the different item types.

      This parameter supports a variety of operators to further refine
      the results returns.

      * `""` - by wrapping a query in double quotes only exact matches are
        returned by the API. Exact searches do not return search matches
        based on specific character sequences. Instead, they return
        matches based on phrases, that is, word sequences. For example:
        A search for `"Blue-Box"` may return search results including
        the sequence `"blue.box"`, `"Blue Box"`, and `"Blue-Box"`;
        any item containing the words `Blue` and `Box` consecutively, in
        the order specified.
      * `AND` - returns items that contain both the search terms. For
        example, a search for `marketing AND BoxWorks` returns items
        that have both `marketing` and `BoxWorks` within its text in any order.
        It does not return a result that only has `BoxWorks` in its text.
      * `OR` - returns items that contain either of the search terms. For
        example, a search for `marketing OR BoxWorks` returns a result that
        has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this
        operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word
        queries as `OR` unless another supported boolean term is used.
      * `NOT` - returns items that do not contain the search term provided.
        For example, a search for `marketing AND NOT BoxWorks` returns a result
        that has only `marketing` within its text. Results containing
        `BoxWorks` are omitted.

      Please note that we do not support lower case (that is,
      `and`, `or`, and `not`) or mixed case (that is, `And`, `Or`, and `Not`)
      operators.

      This field is required unless the `mdfilters` parameter is defined.

  - name: scope
    description: |-
      Limits the search results to either the files that the user has
      access to, or to files available to the entire enterprise.

      The scope defaults to `user_content`, which limits the search
      results to content that is available to the currently authenticated
      user.

      The `enterprise_content` can be requested by an admin through our
      support channels. Once this scope has been enabled for a user, it
      will allow that use to query for content across the entire
      enterprise and not only the content that they have access to.

  - name: created_at_range
    description: |-
      Limits the search results to any items created within
      a given date range.

      Date ranges are defined as comma separated RFC3339
      timestamps.

      If the the start date is omitted (`,2014-05-17T13:35:01-07:00`)
      anything created before the end date will be returned.

      If the end date is omitted (`2014-05-15T13:35:01-07:00,`) the
      current date will be used as the end date instead.
    example:
      - "2014-05-15T13:35:01-07:00"

    description: |-
      Limits the search results to any items updated within
      a given date range.

      Date ranges are defined as comma separated RFC3339
      timestamps.

      If the start date is omitted (`,2014-05-17T13:35:01-07:00`)

  - name: size_range
    description: |-
      Limits the search results to any items with a size within
      a given file size range. This applied to files and folders.

      Size ranges are defined as comma separated list of a lower
      and upper byte size limit (inclusive).

      The upper and lower bound can be omitted to create open ranges.
    example:
      - 1000000

  - name: owner_user_ids
    description: |-
      Limits the search results to any items that are owned
      by the given list of owners, defined as a list of comma separated
      user IDs.

      Please note that the items still need to be owned or shared with
      the currently authenticated user for them to show up in the search
      results. If the user does not have access to any files owned by any of
      the users an empty result set will be returned.

      To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the
      `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our
      support team.
    example:
      - "123422"
      - "23532"
      - "3241212"
    in: query
    required: false

  - name: ancestor_folder_ids
    description: |-
      Limits the search results to items within the given
      list of folders, defined as a comma separated lists
      of folder IDs.

      Search results will also include items within any subfolders
      of those ancestor folders.

      Please note that the folders still need to be owned or shared with
      the currently authenticated user. If the folder is not accessible by this
      user, or it does not exist, a `HTTP 404` error code will be returned
      instead.

      To search across an entire enterprise, we recommend using the
      `enterprise_content` scope parameter which can be requested with our
      support team.

  - name: trash_content
    description: |-
      Determines if the search should look in the trash for items.

      By default, this API only returns search results for items
      not currently in the trash (`non_trashed_only`).

      * `trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently in the trash
      * `non_trashed_only` - Only searches for items currently not in
        the trash

  - name: mdfilters
    description: |-
      Limits the search results to any items for which the metadata matches
      the provided filter.

      This parameter contains a list of 1 metadata template to filter
      the search results by. This list can currently only
      contain one entry, though this might be expanded in the future.

      This parameter is required unless the `query` parameter is provided.

        Required unless `query` parameter is defined.

  - name: sort
    description: |-
      Defines the order in which search results are returned. This API
      defaults to returning items by relevance unless this parameter is
      explicitly specified.

      * `relevance` (default) returns the results sorted by relevance to the
      query search term. The relevance is based on the occurrence of the search
      term in the items name, description, content, and additional properties.
      * `modified_at` returns the results ordered in descending order by date
      at which the item was last modified.
    in: query
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
      default: relevance
      enum:
        - modified_at
        - relevance
    example: modified_at

  - name: direction
    description: |-
      Defines the direction in which search results are ordered. This API
      defaults to returning items in descending (`DESC`) order unless this
      parameter is explicitly specified.

      When results are sorted by `relevance` the ordering is locked to returning
      items in descending order of relevance, and this parameter is ignored.
    in: query
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
      default: DESC
      enum:
        - DESC

  - name: include_recent_shared_links
    description: |-
      Defines whether the search results should include any items
      that the user recently accessed through a shared link.

      Please note that when this parameter has been set to true,
      the format of the response of this API changes to return
      a list of [Search Results with
      Shared Links](r://search_results_with_shared_links)
    in: query
    required: false
