      A header required to request specific `representations`
      of a file. Use this in combination with the `fields` query
      parameter to request a specific file representation.

      The general format for these representations is
      `X-Rep-Hints: [...]` where `[...]` is one or many
      hints in the format `[fileType?query]`.

      For example, to request a `png` representation in `32x32`
      as well as `64x64` pixel dimensions provide the following
      hints.

      `x-rep-hints: [jpg?dimensions=32x32][jpg?dimensions=64x64]`

      Additionally, a `text` representation is available for all
      document file types in Box using the `[extracted_text]`
      representation.

      `x-rep-hints: [extracted_text]`

    example: "[pdf]"
    in: header
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
      nullable: true
