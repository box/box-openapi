              Requesting this field creates an expiring Box Embed URL for an
              embedded preview session in an `iframe`.

              This URL will expire after 60 seconds and the session will
              expire after 60 minutes.

              Not all file types are supported for these embed URLs. Box Embed
              is not optimized for mobile browsers and should not be used in web
              experiences designed for mobile devices. Many UI elements, like
              the **download** and **print** options might not show in mobile
              browsers.
