      Sometimes generating a thumbnail can take a few seconds. In these
      situations the API returns a `Location`-header pointing to a
      placeholder graphic for this file type.

      The placeholder graphic can be used in a user interface until the
      thumbnail generation has completed. The `Retry-After`-header indicates
      when to the thumbnail will be ready. At that time, retry this endpoint
      to retrieve the thumbnail.
    headers:
      Retry-After:

          The time in seconds after which the thumbnail will be available.

          Your application  only attempt to get the thumbnail again after
          this time.
