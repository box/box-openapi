description: |-
  To get real-time notification of activity in a Box account, use the long poll
  feature of the /events API. To do so, first call the /events API with an
  OPTIONS call to retrieve the long poll URL to use. Next, make a GET request to
  the provided URL to begin listening for events. If an event occurs within an
  account you are monitoring, you will receive a response with the value
  new_change. It’s important to note that this response will not come with any
  other details, but should serve as a prompt to take further action such as
  calling the /events endpoint with your last known stream_position. After
  sending this response, the server will close the connection and you will need
  to repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.

  If no events occur for a period of time after you make the GET request to the
  long poll URL, you will receive a response with the value reconnect. When you
  receive this response, you’ll make another OPTIONS call to the /events
  endpoint and repeat the long poll process.

  If you receive no events in retry_timeout seconds, you should make another GET
  request to the real time server (i.e. URL in the response). This might be
  necessary in case you do not receive the reconnect message in the face of
  network errors.

  If you receive max_retries error when making GET requests to the real time
  server, you should make another OPTIONS request.
