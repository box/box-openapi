description: |-
    Returns the contents of a `zip` archive in binary format. This URL does not
    require any form of authentication and could be used in a user's browser to
    download the archive to a user's device.

    By default, this URL is only valid for 25 seconds from the creation of the
    request for this archive. Once a download has started it can not be stopped
    and resumed, instead a new request for a zip archive would need to be
    created.

    The URL of this endpoint should not be considered as fixed. Instead, use
    the [Create zip download](e://post_zip_downloads) API to request to create a
    `zip` archive, and then follow the `download_url` field in the response to
    this endpoint.
