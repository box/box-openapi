description: |-
  Create a search using SQL-like syntax to return items that match specific
  metadata.

  By default, this endpoint returns only the most basic info about the items for
  which the query matches. To get additional fields for each item, including any
  of the metadata, use the `fields` attribute in the query.

  This feature currently has limited availability. To enable this feature,
  contact our [Metadata Query team](mailto:metadata-query-feedback@box.com).

      Returns an error when the request body is not valid.

      * `invalid_query` - Any of the provided body parameters might be
      incorrect. This can mean the `query` is incorrect, as well as some cases
      where the `from` value does not represent a valid template.
      * `unexpected_json_type` - An argument from the `query` string is not
      present in `query_param`. For example, `query` of `name = :name` requires
      the `query_param` to include a value for the `name` argument, for example
      `{ "name": "Box, Inc" }`.
