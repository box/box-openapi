              Currently only `review` is supported. This will provide the

              associated request.

            enum:

                      When a task is created with completion rule
                      "all_assignees" (default), the task will only
                      be considered completed when all assignees have
                      completed the task. When a task is created with
                      completion rule "any_assignee", the task will be
                      considered completed when one assignee has
                      completed the task.
            example: all_assignees
            enum:
              - all_assignees
              - any_assignee
