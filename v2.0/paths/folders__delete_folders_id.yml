summary: Delete a folder

description: |-
  Deletes a folder, either permanently or by moving it to
  the trash.

  # Recursive deletion

  This API returns an error if the folder is not empty. You
  can use the `recursive` query parameter to force this
  operation to recursively delete the folder and all of its
  contents.

  # Folder locking

  The enterprise settings determine whether the folder will
  be permanently deleted from Box or moved to the trash.

  During this operation, part of the file tree will be locked, mainly
  the source folder and all of its descendants.

  For the duration of the operation, no other move, copy, delete, or restore
  operation can performed on any of the locked folders.

  # Timeout

  Timeout for this operation is 60 seconds. The operation will include
  after a `HTTP 503` has been returned.
