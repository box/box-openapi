          policy_name:
            description: |-
              The name of the policy.
            example: "Sales Policy"

          filter_started_at:
            description: |-
              The filter start date.

              When this policy is applied using a `custodian` legal
              hold assignments, it will only apply to file versions
              created or uploaded inside of the
              date range. Other assignment types, such as folders and
              files, will ignore the date filter.

              Required if `is_ongoing` is set to `false`.
            example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
            type: string
            maxLength: 500
            format: "yyyymmddThhmmss+|-hhmm"

          filter_ended_at:
            description: |-
              The filter end date.

              When this policy is applied using a `custodian` legal
              hold assignments, it will only apply to file versions
              created or uploaded inside of the
              date range. Other assignment types, such as folders and
              files, will ignore the date filter.

              Required if `is_ongoing` is set to `false`.
            example: "2012-12-18T10:53:43-08:00"
            type: string
            maxLength: 500
            format: "yyyymmddThhmmss+|-hhmm"

          is_ongoing:
            description: |-
              Whether new assignments under this policy should
              continue applying to files even after initialization.

              When this policy is applied using a legal hold assignment,
              it will continue applying the policy to any new file versions
              even after it has been applied.

              For example, if a legal hold assignment is placed on a user
              today, and that user uploads a file tomorrow, that file will
              get held. This will continue until the policy is retired.

              Required if no filter dates are set.
            example: true
            type: boolean
