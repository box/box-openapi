      Returns an error when the request body is not valid.

      * `invalid_query` - Any of the provided body parameters might be
      incorrect. This can mean the `query` is incorrect, as well as some cases
      where the `from` value does not represent a valid template.
      * `unexpected_json_type` - An argument from the `query` string is not
      present in `query_param`. For example, `query` of `name = :name` requires
      the `query_param` to include a value for the `name` argument, for example
      `{ "name": "Box, Inc" }`.
