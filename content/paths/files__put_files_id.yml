            description: |-
              An optional different name for the file. This can be used to
              rename the file.

                  An optional new parent folder for the file. This can be used
                  to move the file to a new folder.

          shared_link:
            allOf:
              - $ref: "../attributes/shared_link.yml"
              - description: |-
                  Defines a shared link for a file. Set this to `null` to remove
                  the shared link.

          lock:
            type: object
            description: |-
              Defines a lock on an item. This prevents the item from being
              moved, renamed, or otherwise changed by anyone other than the user
              who created the lock.

              Set this to `null` to remove the lock.

              access:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The type of this object.
                enum:
                  - lock
                example: "lock"

              expires_at:
                type: string
                format: date-time
                example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
                description: |-
                  Defines the time at which the lock expires.

              is_download_prevented:
                type: boolean
                example: true
                description: |-
                  Defines if the file can be downloaded while it is locked.

          permissions:
            description: |-
              Defines who can download a file.
            type: object
            properties:
              can_download:
                description: |-
                  Defines who is allowed to download this file. The possible
                  values are either `open` for everyone or `company` for just
                  the other members of the user's enterprise.

                  This setting overrides the download permissions that are
                  normally part of the `role` of a collaboration. When set to
                  `company`, this essentially removes the download option for
                  external users with `viewer` or `editor` a roles.
                type: string
                example: open
                enum:
                  - open
                  - company
