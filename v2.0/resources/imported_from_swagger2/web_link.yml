title: Web Link Object
description: |-
  Web links are objects that point to URLs. These objects are also known as
  bookmarks within the Box web application. Web link objects are treated
  similarly to file objects, so they will also support shared links, copy,
  permanent delete, and restore with the format /web_links/{WEB_LINK_ID} in
  place of /files/{FILE_ID}.
