  operation can performed on any of the locked folders.

                  Specifies an optional ID of a folder to restore the folder
                  to when the original folder no longer exists.

                  Please be aware that this ID will only be used if the original
                  folder no longer exists. Use this ID to provide a fallback
                  location to restore the folder to if the original location
                  has been deleted.
