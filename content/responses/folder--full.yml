              An object containing the metadata instances that have been
              attached to this folder.

              Each metadata instance is uniquely identified by its `scope` and
              `templateKey`. There can only be one instance of any metadata
              template attached to each folder. Each metadata instance is nested
              within an object with the `templateKey` as the key, which again
              itself is nested in an object with the `scope` as the key.
