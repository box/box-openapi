description: |-
  Retrieves the files and/or folders contained within this folder without any
  other metadata about the folder. Any attribute in the full files or folders
  objects can be passed in with the fields parameter to get specific attributes,
  and only those specific attributes back; otherwise, the mini format is
  returned for each item by default.
