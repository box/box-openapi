              associated request.

                      When a task is created with completion rule
                      `all_assignees` (default), the task will only
                      be considered completed when all assignees have
                      completed the task. When a task is created with
                      completion rule `any_assignee`, the task will be
                      considered completed when one assignee has
                      completed the task.
            example: all_assignees
            enum:
              - all_assignees
              - any_assignee
