          scope:
            type: string
            description: |-
              The scope of the metadata template to create. Applications can
              only create templates for use within the authenticated user's
              enterprise.

              This value needs to be set to `enterprise`, as `global` scopes can
              not be created by applications.
            example: enterprise

          templateKey:
            type: string
            example: productInfo
            description: |-
              A unique identifier for the template. This identifier needs to be
              unique across the enterprise for which the metadata template is
              being created.

              When not provided, the API will create a unique `templateKey`
              based on the value of the `displayName`.

              Defines if this template is visible in the Box web app UI, or if
              it is purely intended for usage through the API.
            default: false

          fields:
            type: array
            description: |-
              An ordered list of template fields which are part of the template.
              Each field can be a regular text field, date field, number field,
              as well as a single or multi-select list.

            description: |-
              Whether or not to copy any metadata attached to a file or folder
              when it is copied. By default, metadata is not copied along with a
              file or folder when it is copied.

      Returned when the user does not have the permission to create the metadata
      template. This can happen for a few reasons, most commonly when the user
      does not have (co-)admin permissions, or the application tries to create a
      template with the `global` scope.
