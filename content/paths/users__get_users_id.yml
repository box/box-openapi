  Retrieves information about a user in the enterprise.

  The application and the authenticated user need to
  have the permission to look up users in the entire
  enterprise.

  This endpoint also returns a limited set of information
  for external users who are collaborated on content
  owned by the enterprise for authenticated users with the
  right scopes. In this case, disallowed fields will return
  null instead.

      parameter.
