              Indicates whether the sign_files documents are processing
              and the PDFs may be out of date. A change to any document
              requires processing on all sign_files. So, it is
              recommended to wait until processing has finished
              (and this value is true) before downloading the PDFs.
              Webhooks are not sent until processing has
              been completed.

          and can be downloaded at any point in the signing process.
