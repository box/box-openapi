# Translation

On a regular schedule a snapshot of the `en` branch is created on the
`en-snapshot` branch and imported into our in-house translation system
(`Moji`) and sent off for translation.

Once the translation is completed, the translated content is pushed to the `jp`
branch, which then triggers a rebuild of the Japanese developer documentation.
