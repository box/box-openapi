              Update the expiration date for the collaboration. At this date,
              the collaboration will be automatically removed from the item.

              This feature will only work if the **Automatically remove invited
              collaborators: Allow folder owners to extend the expiry date**
              setting has been enabled in the **Enterprise Settings**
              of the **Admin Console**. When the setting is not enabled,
              collaborations can not have an expiry date and a value for this
              field will be result in an error.

              Additionally, a collaboration can only be given an
              expiration if it was created after the **Automatically remove
              invited collaborator** setting was enabled.
            example: '2019-08-29T23:59:00-07:00'
