description: |-
  Get a list of previous file versions for a legal hold
  assignment.

  In some cases you may only need the latest file versions instead. In these
  cases, use the `GET  /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API
  instead to return any current (latest) versions of a file for this legal hold
  policy assignment.

  Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all files
  held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return past file versions
  held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET /file_version_legal_holds`
  API can be used to fetch current and past versions of files held within the
  legacy architecture.

  The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
  find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.
