name: content-range
description: |-
  The byte range of the chunk.

  Must not overlap with the range of a part already
  uploaded this session. Each partâ€™s size must be
  exactly equal in size to the part size specified
  in the upload session that you created.
  One exception is the last part of the file, as this can be smaller.

  When providing the value for `content-range`, remember that:

  * The lower bound of each part's byte range
    must be a multiple of the part size.
  * The higher bound must be a multiple of the part size - 1.


example: "bytes 8388608-16777215/445856194"
