description: |-
  Get a list of current file versions for a legal hold
  assignment.

  In some cases you may want to get previous file versions instead. In these
  cases, use the `GET  /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold`
  API instead to return any previous versions of a file for this legal hold
  policy assignment.

  Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all file
  versions held for this policy ID. Instead, this API will only return the
  latest file version held in the newly developed architecture. The `GET
  /file_version_legal_holds` API can be used to fetch current and past versions
  of files held within the legacy architecture.

  The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
  find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.
