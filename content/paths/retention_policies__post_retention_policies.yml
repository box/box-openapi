              The additional text description of the retention policy.

            example: finite
            description: |-
              The type of the retention policy. A retention
              policy type can either be `finite`, where a
              specific amount of time to retain the content is known
              upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time
              to retain the content is still unknown.
            enum:

              - indefinite

          disposition_action:
            type: string
            example: permanently_delete
            description: |-
              The disposition action of the retention policy.
              `permanently_delete` deletes the content
              retained by the policy permanently.
              `remove_retention` lifts retention policy
              from the content, allowing it to be deleted
              by users once the retention policy has expired.
            enum:
              - permanently_delete
              - remove_retention

            description: |-
              The length of the retention policy. This value
              specifies the duration in days when the retention
              policy will be active for after being assigned to
              content.  If the policy has a `policy_type` of
              `indefinite`, the `retention_length` will also be
              `indefinite`.
