          Keeps track of which external source this group is
          coming from (e.g. "Active Directory", "Google Groups",
          "Facebook Groups").  Setting this will
          also prevent Box users from editing the group name
          and its members directly via the Box web application.
          This is desirable for one-way syncing of groups.

          An arbitrary identifier that can be used by
          external group sync tools to link this Box Group to
          an external group. Example values of this field
          could be an Active Directory Object ID or a Google
          Group ID.  We recommend you use of this field in
          order to avoid issues when group names are updated in
          either Box or external systems.
