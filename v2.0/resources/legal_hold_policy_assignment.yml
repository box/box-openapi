  Legal Hold Assignments are used to assign Legal Hold
  Policies to UY, Folders, Files, or File Versions.

  Creating a Legal Hold Assignment puts a hold
  on the File-Versions that belong to the Assignment's
  'apply-to' entity.

          When the assignment release request was sent.
          (Because it can take time for an assignment to fully
          delete, this isn't quite the same time that the
          assignment is fully deleted). If null, Assignment
          was not deleted.
