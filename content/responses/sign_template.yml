          Message to include in signature request email. The field
          is cleaned through sanitization of specific characters. However,
          some html tags are allowed. Links included in the
          message are also converted to hyperlinks in the email. The
          message may contain the following html tags including `a`, `abbr`,
          `acronym`, `b`, `blockquote`, `code`, `em`, `i`, `ul`, `li`, `ol`, and

          to html ratio is too high, the email
          may end up in spam filters. Custom styles on
          these tags are not allowed.

          available to Box Verified Enterprises.
