description: |-
    Returns the download status of a `zip` archive, allowing an application to
    inspect the progress of the download as well as the number of items that
    might have been skipped.

    This endpoint can only be accessed once the download has started.
    Subsequently this endpoint is valid for 12 hours from the start of the
    download.

    The URL of this endpoint should not be considered as fixed. Instead, use
    the [Create zip download](e://post_zip_downloads) API to request to create a
    `zip` archive, and then follow the `status_url` field in the response to
    this endpoint.
