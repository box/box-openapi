name: fields
description: |-
  A comma-separated list of attributes to include in the
  response. This can be used to request fields that are
  not normally returned in a standard response.

  Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the
  effect that none of the standard fields are returned in
  the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
  fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
  to the fields requested.

  Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata
  applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well
  as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example
  `?field=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.
