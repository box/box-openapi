description: |-
  Defines a shared link for an item. Set this to `null` to remove
  the shared link.

type: object

properties:
  access:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The level of access for the shared link. This can be
      restricted to anyone with the link (`open`), only people
      within the company (`company`) and only those who
      have been invited to the folder (`collaborators`).

      If not set, this field defaults to the access level specified
      by the enterprise admin. To create a shared link with this
      default setting pass the `shared_link` object with
      no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

      The `company` access level is only available to paid
      accounts.
    enum:
      - open
      - company
      - collaborators
    example: "open"

  password:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The password required to access the shared link. Set the
      password to `null` to remove it.
      Passwords must now be at least eight characters
      long and include a number, upper case letter, or
      a non-numeric or non-alphabetical character.
      A password can only be set when `access` is set to `open`.
    example: "do-n8t-use-this-Password"

  vanity_name:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Defines a custom vanity name to use in the shared link URL,
      for example `https://app.box.com/v/my-shared-link`.

      Custom URLs should not be used when sharing sensitive content
      as vanity URLs are a lot easier to guess than regular shared links.
    example: "my-shared-link"

  unshared_at:
    type: string
    format: date-time
    example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
    description: |-
      The timestamp at which this shared link will
      expire. This field can only be set by
      users with paid accounts.

  permissions:
    type: object
    properties:
      can_download:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        description: |-
          If the shared link allows for downloading of files.
          This can only be set when `access` is set to
          `open` or `company`.
