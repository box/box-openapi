              Requesting this field creates an expiring Box Embed URL for an
              embedded preview session in an `iframe`.

              This URL will expire after 60 seconds and the session will
              expire after 60 minutes.

              Not all file types are supported for these embed URLs. Box Embed
              is not optimized for mobile browsers and should not be used in web
              experiences designed for mobile devices. Many UI elements, like
              the **download** and **print** options might not show in mobile
              browsers.

        description: |-
          A list of key-value pairs of metadata objects within their
          scopes.

          To access the metadata for a file, first use the
          Metadata-endpoints to determine
          the metadata templates available to your enterprise.

          Then use the `GET /files/:id` endpoint with
          the `fields` query parameter to get the metadata by ID.

          The ID for a metadata template will be in the format
          `metadata.<scope>.<templatename>`, for example
          `metadata.global.properties`.

        example:
          enterprise_27335:
            marketingCollateral:
              $canEdit: true

              A list of representations for a file that can be used to
              display a placeholder of the file in your application. By default
              this returns all representations and we recommend using the
              `X-Rep-Hints` header to further customize the desired
              representations.
