              The disposition action of the retention policy.
              This action can be `permanently_delete`, which
              will cause the content retained by the policy
              to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`,
              which will lift the retention policy from the content,
              allowing it to be deleted by users,
              once the retention policy time period has passed.
