Response schemas are located in the `content/responses/` folder. Every response
is written as a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file.

## Quick start

1. Determine the type of the `resource`, either a
   - `request`
   - `response`
   - `error`
   - `callback`
   - or generic `schema`
2. Based on that answer, create a file in 
   - `content/requests/*`
   - `content/responses/*`
   - `content/errors/*`,
   - `content/callbacks/*`
   - or `content/schemas/*`
   - An example would be `content/responses/file.yml`.
3. Add the default content to the file:
   - A short `title` to give the resource a short human-readable name. Please do
      not use `a`, `an`, or `the` in the title.
   - A `description` to further elaborate on the title.
   - A `type`, which in most cases is either an `object` or an `array`.
   - A unique `x-box-resource-id` if you want the schema to be listed in the
      public developer documentation. Omitting this will hide the resource.
   - A a list of `properties` for each of the fields of the resource.

### Example

```yml
---
title: File
description: The information about a file
type: object
x-box-resource-id: file
properties:
  id:
    type: string
    description: The unique identifier for this file
    example: "11446498"

  type:
    description: |-
      The type of this file, which is always `file`.
    type: string
    example: file
    enum:
      - file
```

### Properties

Almost every schema has a list of `properties`. Please make sure that every
property:

- has a `type` and optional `format`, for example `string` and `date-time`.
- has a `description` and a realistic `example`
- has an `enum` of values if the returned values are only a limited list
- is separated by a new line to improve readability
