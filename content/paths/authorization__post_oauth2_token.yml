summary: |-
  Request an access token

description: |-
  Request an Access Token using either a client-side obtained OAuth 2.0
  authorization code or a server-side JWT assertion.

  An Access Token is a string that enables Box to verify that a
  request belongs to an authorized session. In the normal order of
  operations you will begin by requesting authentication from the
  [authorize](#get-authorize) endpoint and Box will send you an
  authorization code.

  You will then send this code to this endpoint to exchange it for
  an Access Token. The returned Access Token can then be used to to make
  Box API calls.
