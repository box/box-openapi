  - name: range

      The byte range of the content to download.

      The format `{start_byte}-{end_byte}` can be used to specify
      what section of the file to download.

    required: false

  - name: access_token
    description:
      An optional access token that can be used to pre-authenticate this
      request, which means that a download link can be shared with a browser or
      a third party service without them needing to know how to handle the
      authentication.

      When using this parameter, please make sure that the access token is
      sufficiently scoped down to only allow read access to that file and no
      other files or folders.
    example: "c3FIOG9vSGV4VHo4QzAyg5T1JvNnJoZ3ExaVNyQWw6WjRsanRKZG5lQk9qUE1BVQ"
