  A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
  for a specified amount of time. Admins can apply policies to
  specified folders, or an entire enterprise. A file version retention
  is a  record for a retained file version. To use this feature,
  you must  have the manage retention policies scope enabled for your
  API key via  your application management console. For more information
  about retention policies, please visit our help documentation
