                  An optional new parent folder for the file. This can be used
                  to move the file to a new folder.

              - description: |-
                  Defines a shared link for a file. Set this to `null` to remove
                  the shared link.

          lock:
            type: object
            description: |-
              Defines a lock on an item. This prevents the item from being
              moved, renamed, or otherwise changed by anyone other than the user
              who created the lock.

              Set this to `null` to remove the lock.

              access:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The type of this object.
                enum:
                  - lock
                example: "lock"

              expires_at:
                type: string
                format: date-time
                example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
                description: |-
                  Defines the time at which the lock expires.

              is_download_prevented:
                type: boolean
                example: true
                description: |-
                  Defines if the file can be downloaded while it is locked.

          permissions:
            description: |-
              Defines who can download a file.
            type: object
            properties:
              can_download:
                description: |-
                  Defines who is allowed to download this file. The possible
                  values are either `open` for everyone or `company` for
                  the other members of the user's enterprise.

                  This setting overrides the download permissions that are
                  normally part of the `role` of a collaboration. When set to
                  `company`, this essentially removes the download option for
                  external users with `viewer` or `editor` a roles.
                type: string
                example: open
                enum:
                  - open
                  - company
