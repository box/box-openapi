              The desired behavior for conflict-resolution if a template already
              exists on a given file or folder.

              * `none` will preserve the existing value on the file
              * `overwrite` will force-apply the templates values over
                any existing values.
            example: "overwrite"

      Returns the metadata cascade policy when the policy has been
      applied.

      The metadata cascade operation will be kicked off asynchronously.
      The API call will return right away but before the cascade operation
      is complete. There is currently no way to check for when this
      operation has finished.
