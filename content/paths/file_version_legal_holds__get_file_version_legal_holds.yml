summary: List file version legal holds

x-box-tag: file_version_legal_holds

description: |-
  Get a list of file versions on legal hold for a legal hold
  assignment.

  Due to ongoing re-architecture efforts this API might not return all file
  versions for this policy ID.

  Instead, this API will only return file versions held in the legacy
  architecture. Two new endpoints will available to request any file versions
  held in the new architecture.

  For file versions held in the new architecture, the `GET
  /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/file_versions_on_hold` API can be used to
  return all past file versions available for this policy assignment, and the
  `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments/:id/files_on_hold` API can be used to
  return any current (latest) versions of a file under legal hold.

  The `GET /legal_hold_policy_assignments?policy_id={id}` API can be used to
  find a list of policy assignments for a given policy ID.

  Once the re-architecture is completed this API will be deprecated.
