summary: Restore Folder
description: |-
  Restores an item that has been moved to the trash. Default behavior is to
  restore the item to the folder it was in before it was moved to the trash. If
  that parent folder no longer exists or if there is now an item with the same
  name in that parent folder, the new parent folder and/or new name will need to
  be included in the request.
