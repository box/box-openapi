          Tracks Boxâ€™s progress in processing all the parts
          that have been

          uploaded. Always equal to 0 when creating new
          upload session. In other

          cases, this will be the number of parts that have
          been processed by

          server. When all parts have been uploaded, but
          Commit API returned

          202, you can check this value == total_parts to
          check if file was

          uploaded.
