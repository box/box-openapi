          shared_link:
            description: |-
              The settings for the shared link to create on the file.

              Use an empty object (`{}`) to use the default settings for shared
              links.

            type: object
            properties:
              access:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The level of access for the shared link. This can be
                  restricted to anyone with the link (`open`), only people
                  within the company (`company`) and only those who
                  have been invited to the file (`collaborators`).

                  If not set, this field defaults to the access level specified
                  by the enterprise admin. To create a shared link with this
                  default setting pass the `shared_link` object with
                  no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

                  The `company` access level is only available to paid
                  accounts.
                enum:
                  - open
                  - company
                  - collaborators
                example: "open"

              password:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The password required to access the shared link. Set the
                  password to `null` to remove it.

                  A password can only be set when `access` is set to `open`.
                example: "do-not-use-this-password"

              unshared_at:
                type: string
                format: date-time
                example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
                description: |-
                  The timestamp at which this shared link will
                  expire. This field can only be set by
                  users with paid accounts.

              permissions:
                type: object
                properties:
                  can_download:
                    type: boolean
                    example: true
                    description: |-
                      If the shared link allows for downloading of files.
                      This can only be set when `access` is set to
                      `open` or `company`.
