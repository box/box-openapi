              The type of the retention policy. A retention
              policy type can either be `finite`, where a
              specific amount of time to retain the content is known
              upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time
              to retain the content is still unknown.

              The disposition action of the retention policy.
              This action can be `permanently_delete`, which
              will cause the content retained by the policy
              to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`,
              which will lift the retention policy from the content,
              allowing it to be deleted by users,
              once the retention policy has expired.

              content.  If the policy has A `policy_type` of
              `indefinite`, the `retention_length` will also be
              `indefinite`.
