summary: Shared Items

  Shared items are any files or folders that are represented by a shared link.
  Shared items are different from other API resources in that a shared resource
  doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be in the account of the user accessing it. The
  actual shared link itself is used along with a normal access token.

  Used to retrieve the metadata about a shared item when only given a shared
  link. Because of varying permission for shared links, a password may be
  required to retrieve the shared item. Once the item has been retrieved, you
  can make API requests against the actual resource /files/{id} or /folders/{id}
  as long as the shared link and optional password are in the header.
