summary: 'Update Folder, Create Shared Link, Create or Delete'
description: |-
  Used to update information about the folder. To move a folder, update the ID
  of its parent. To enable an email address that can be used to upload files to
  this folder, update the folder_upload_email attribute. An optional If-Match
  header can be included to ensure that client only updates the folder if it
  knows about the latest version.


  Used to create a shared link for this particular folder. Please see here for
  more information on the permissions available for shared links. In order to
  get default shared link status, set it to an empty access level, i.e.
  {"shared_link": {}}. In order to disable a shared link, send this same type of
  PUT request with the value of shared_link set to null, i.e. {"shared_link":
  null}


  To add or remove an item from a collection, you do a PUT on that item and
  change the list of collections it belongs to. Philosophically, this is similar
  to the way “move” operations work on files and folders: you do a PUT on the
  item and change its parent. It’s the same idea with collections, except you’re
  changing which collection(s) the item belongs to instead of the folder it
  belongs to. Currently the only collection available is the favorites
  collection, and you’ll need to know it’s ID for the user that is making the
  API call, since every user has a different favorites collection_id.

  The Add/Remove API handling will check all ids passed in before performing any
  add/removal operations. If any collection ids are malformed or do not exist in
  the user’s account, the API call will throw a 400. Only if all of the
  collection ids are valid will the adds and removals be carried out.
