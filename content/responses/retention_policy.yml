description: |-
  A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
  for a specified amount of time. Admins can create retention
  policies and then later assign them to specific folders
  or their entire enterprise.  To use this feature, you must
  have the manage retention policies scope enabled
  for your API key via your application management console.

        example: "Policy to retain all reports for at least one month"
        description: |-
          The additional text description of the retention policy.

      policy_type:
        type: string
        example: finite
        description: |-
          The type of the retention policy. A retention
          policy type can either be `finite`, where a
          specific amount of time to retain the content is known
          upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time
          to retain the content is still unknown.
        enum:
          - finite
          - indefinite

      retention_type:
        type: string
        example: modifiable
        description: |-
          Specifies the retention type:

          * `modifiable`: You can modify the retention policy. For example,
           you can add or remove folders, shorten or lengthen
           the policy duration, or delete the policy.
           Use this type if your retention policy
           is not related to any regulatory purposes.

          * `non-modifiable`: You can modify the retention policy
           only in a limited way: add a folder, lengthen the duration,
           retire the policy, change the disposition action
           or notification settings. You cannot perform other actions,
           such as deleting the policy or shortening its duration.
           Use this type when you want to ensure
           compliance with regulatory retention policies.
        enum:
          - modifiable
          - non-modifiable

      status:
        type: string
        example: active
        description: |-
          The status of the retention policy. The status of
          a policy will be `active`, unless explicitly retired by an
          administrator, in which case the status will be `retired`.
          Once a policy has been retired, it cannot become
          active again.
        enum:
          - active
          - retired
