title: Folder Object
description: |-
  Folders contain information about the items contained inside of them,
  including files and other folders. There is also a set of metadata such as who
  owns the folder and when it was modified that is also returned. When accessing
  other resources that make reference to folders, a ‘mini folder’ object will be
  used. The 'mini folder' object will return type, id, sequence_id, etag, and
  name.
