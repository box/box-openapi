  schema:
    type: string
    enum:
    - code

- name: client_id
  description: |-
    The client ID of the application requesting authentication. To 
    get the client ID for your application, log in to your Box developer 
    console and click the Edit Application link for the application 
    you're working with. In the OAuth 2 Parameters section of the 
    configuration page, find the item labeled "client_id". The text

  schema:
    type: string

- name: redirect_uri
  description: |-
    The URL to which Box redirects the browser when authentication 
    completes. The user's actual interaction with your application 
    begins when Box redirects to this URL. You must supply the redirect 
    URL in the configuration page of your application. It must be a 
    valid HTTPS URL that resolves to a valid IP address. The IP 
    address must not be a Box address, and there must be a working 
    web service or application accessible at the address that 
    can correctly handle Box requests.
  in: query
  required: true
  schema:
    type: string

- name: state
  description: |-
    A text string that you choose. Box sends the same string to 
    your redirect URL when authentication is complete. This 
    parameter is provided for your use in protecting against hijacked 
    sessions and other attacks.
  in: query
  required: true
  schema:
    type: string
- name: scope
  description: |-
    This optional parameter identifies the Box scopes available 
    to the application once it's authenticated. If you don't 
    supply this parameter then Box grants access to the default 
    scopes configured for the application in its configuration page. 
    You can limit the scopes available to the application by 
    passing a comma-separated list of Box scopes.
