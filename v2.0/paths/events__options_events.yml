  Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling updates
  to the [event stream](#get-events).

  Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the
  server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to receive
  updated responses.

  Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for
  enterprise events.

  To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll
  URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.

  When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value
  `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as
  it simply serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a
  request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known
  `stream_position`.

  After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now
  repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.

  If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will
  receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response
  youâ€™ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.

  If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to
  make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response
  for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.

  Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the
  real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint
  first.

      instead of the regular endpoints for long-polling events.
