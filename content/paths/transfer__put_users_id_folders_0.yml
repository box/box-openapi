x-box-tag: transfer

summary: Transfer owned folders

tags:
  - Transfer folders

description: |-
  Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user into
  another user's account

  Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.

  Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative
  permissions.

  All existing shared links and folder-level collaborations are transferred
  during the operation. Please note that while collaborations at the individual
  file-level are transferred during the operation, the collaborations are
  deleted when the original user is deleted.

  This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow response
  when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.

  If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of
  the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off
  asynchronously.

  There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.

  The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and
  Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.

  To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and write
  all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.

  Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay Lite`,
  and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being
  transferred.

  Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed.
