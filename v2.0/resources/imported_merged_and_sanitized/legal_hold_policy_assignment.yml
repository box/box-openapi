  Legal Hold Assignments are used to assign Legal Hold
  Policies to Custodians,

  Folders, Files, or File Versions. Creating a Legal Hold
  Assignment puts a hold

  on the File-Versions that belong to the Assignment's
  'apply-to' entity.

          (Because it can take time

          for an assignment to fully delete, this isn't
          quite the same time that the

          assignment is fully deleted). If null, Assignment
          was not deleted.
