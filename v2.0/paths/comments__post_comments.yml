          message:
            type: string
            description: |-
              The text of the comment.

              To mention a user, user the `tagged_message`
              parameter instead.
            example: "Review completed!"

          tagged_message:
            type: string
            description: |-
              The text of the comment, including `@[user_id:name]`
              somewhere in the message to mention another user, which
              will send them an email notification, letting them know
              they have been mentioned.

              The `user_id` is the target user's ID, where the `name`
              can be any custom phrase. In the Box UI this name will
              link to the user's profile.

              If you are not mentioning another user, use`message`
              instead.
            example: "@[1234:John] Review completed!"
