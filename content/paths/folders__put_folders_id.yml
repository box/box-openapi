            description: |-
              An array of collections to make this folder
              a member of. Currently
              we only support the `favorites` collection.

              To get the ID for a collection, use the
              [List all collections][1] endpoint.

              Passing an empty array `[]` or `null` will remove
              the folder from all collections.

              Restricts collaborators who are not the owner of
              this folder from viewing other collaborations on
              this folder.

              It also restricts non-owners from inviting new
              collaborators.

              When setting this field to `false`, it is required
              to also set `can_non_owners_invite_collaborators` to
              `false` if it has not already been set.

      Returns a folder object for the updated folder

      Not all available fields are returned by default. Use the
      [fields](#param-fields) query parameter to explicitly request
      any specific fields.

      This call will return synchronously. This holds true even when
      moving folders with a large a large number of items in all of its
      descendants. For very large folders, this means the call could
      take minutes or hours to return.
