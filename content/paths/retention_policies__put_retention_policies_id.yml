              The additional text description of the retention policy.

          disposition_action:

            example: permanently_delete
            description: |-
              The disposition action of the retention policy.
              `permanently_delete` deletes the content
              retained by the policy permanently.
              `remove_retention` lifts retention policy
              from the content, allowing it to be deleted
              by users once the retention policy has expired.
            enum:
              - permanently_delete
              - remove_retention

          retention_type:
            type: string
            example: non-modifiable
            description: |-
              Specifies the retention type:

              * `modifiable`: You can modify the retention policy. For example,
              you can add or remove folders, shorten or lengthen
              the policy duration, or delete the assignment.
              Use this type if your retention policy
              is not related to any regulatory purposes.
              * `non-modifiable`: You can modify the retention policy
              only in a limited way: add a folder, lengthen the duration,
              retire the policy, change the disposition action
              or notification settings. You cannot perform other actions,
              such as deleting the assignment or shortening the
              policy duration. Use this type to ensure
              compliance with regulatory retention policies.

              When updating a retention policy, you can use
              `non-modifiable` type only. You can convert a
              `modifiable` policy to `non-modifiable`, but
              not the other way around.

          retention_length:
            type: string
            format: int32
            example: "365"
            description: |-
              The length of the retention policy. This value
              specifies the duration in days that the retention
              policy will be active for after being assigned to
              content.  If the policy has a `policy_type` of
              `indefinite`, the `retention_length` will also be
              `indefinite`.

          status:
            type: string
            example: retired
            description: |-
              Used to retire a retention policy.

              If not retiring a policy, do not include this parameter
              or set it to `null`.
