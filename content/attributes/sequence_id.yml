description: |-
  A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
  that has been applied to this item.

  This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
  to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
  identifier was read.

  An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
  would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
  user events for changes to the item. The application would
  ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
  is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
  fetched resource.
