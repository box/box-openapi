summary: 'List user and enterprise events'

tags:

x-box-tag: events

description: |-
  Returns up to a year of past events for a given user
  or for the entire enterprise.

  By default this returns events for the authenticated user. To retrieve
  events for the entire enterprise, set the `stream_type` to `admin_logs`.
  The user making the API call will need to have admin privileges, and
  the application will need to have the permission to access the event feed
  to get the enterprise event feed.

parameters:
  - name: stream_type
    description: |-
      Defines the type of events that are returned

      * `all` returns everything for a user and is the default
      * `changes` returns events that may cause file tree changes
        such as file updates or collaborations.
      * `sync` is similar to `changes` but only applies to synced folders
      * `admin_logs` returns all events for an entire enterprise and
        requires the user making the API call to have admin permissions.

  - name: stream_position
    description: |-
      The location in the event stream to start receiving events from.

      * `0` or `null` will return all events.

      chunk, as well as the next `stream_position` that can be
