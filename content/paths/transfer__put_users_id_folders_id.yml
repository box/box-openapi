x-box-reference-category: transfer

summary: Transfer owned folders

tags:
  - Users

description: |-
  Move all of the items owned by a user into a
  new folder in another user’s account.

  Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.

  Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative
  permissions.

  This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow response
  when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.

  If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of
  the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off
  asynchronously.

  There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.
