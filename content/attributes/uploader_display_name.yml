title: Uploader display name

type: string

example: Ellis Wiggins

nullable: false

description: |-
  The display name of the user that uploaded the file. In most cases this is the
  name of the user logged in at the time of the upload.

  If the file was uploaded using a File Request form that requires the user to
  provide an email address, this field is populated with that email address. If
  an email address was not required in the File Request form, this field is set
  to return a value of `File Request`.

  In all other anonymous cases where no email was provided this field
  will default to a value of `Someone`.
