operationId: get_folders_trash_items

summary: List trashed items

tags:
  - Trashed items

x-box-tag: trashed_items

description: |-
  Retrieves the files and folders that have been moved
  to the trash.

  Any attribute in the full files or folders objects can be passed
  in with the `fields` parameter to retrieve those specific
  attributes that are not returned by default.

  This endpoint defaults to use offset-based pagination, yet also supports
  marker-based pagination using the `marker` parameter.

parameters:
  - $ref: '../attributes/fields.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/limit.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/offset.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/usemarker.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/marker.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/direction.yml'

  - name: sort
    description: |-
      Defines the **second** attribute by which items
      are sorted.

      Items are always sorted by their `type` first, with
      folders listed before files, and files listed
      before web links.

      This parameter is not supported when using marker-based pagination.

      Returns an error if some of the parameters are missing or
      not valid.

      * `invalid_parameter` can appear when the `sort`, `direction` or `offset`
      parameter is provided when using marker based pagination, or when the
      `marker` parameter is provided but `usemarker` is set to `false` or
      `null`.
