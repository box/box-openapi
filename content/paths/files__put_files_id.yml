                  An optional new parent folder for the file. This can be used

            type: object
            description: |-
              Defines a lock on an item. This prevents the item from being
              moved, renamed, or otherwise changed by anyone other than the user
              who created the lock.

              Set this to `null` to remove the lock.

                  The type of this object.
                enum:

                description: |-
                  Defines the time at which the lock expires.

                description: |-
                  Defines if the file can be downloaded while it is locked.

          disposition_at:
            type: string
            format: date-time
            example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
            description: |-
              The retention expiration timestamp for the given file. This
              date cannot be shortened once set on a file.

          permissions:
            description: |-
              Defines who can download a file.
            type: object
            properties:
              can_download:
                description: |-
                  Defines who is allowed to download this file. The possible
                  values are either `open` for everyone or `company` for
                  the other members of the user's enterprise.

                  This setting overrides the download permissions that are
                  normally part of the `role` of a collaboration. When set to
                  `company`, this essentially removes the download option for
                  external users with `viewer` or `editor` a roles.
                type: string
                example: open
                enum:
                  - open
                  - company

          collections:
            type: array
            description: |-
              An array of collections to make this file
              a member of. Currently
              we only support the `favorites` collection.

              To get the ID for a collection, use the
              [List all collections][1] endpoint.

              Passing an empty array `[]` or `null` will remove
              the file from all collections.
