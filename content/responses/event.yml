          event is attributed to a unknown user (`user_id = 2`)

      This object provides additional information about the event if available.

      This can include how a user performed an event as well as additional
      information to correlate an event to external KeySafe logs. Not all events
      have an `additional_details` object.  This object is only available in the
      Enterprise Events.
