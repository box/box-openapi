summary: Promote file version

tags:
  - File versions

x-box-tag: file_versions

description: |-
  Promote a specific version of a file.

  If previous versions exist, this method can be used to
  promote one of the older versions to the top of the version history.

  This creates a new copy of the old version and puts it at the
  top of the versions history. The file will have the exact same contents
  as the older version, with the the same hash digest, `etag`, and
  name as the original.

  Other properties such as comments do not get updated to their
  former values.

  Don't use this endpoint to restore Box Notes,
  as it works with file formats such as PDF, DOC,
  PPTX or similar.
