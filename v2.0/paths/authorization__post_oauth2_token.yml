  Request an Access Token

description: |-
  Request an Access Token using either client-side obtained OAuth2
  authorization code or a JWT assertion.

  An access token is a data string that enables Box to verify that a
  request belongs to an authorized session. In the normal order of operations
  you will begin by requesting authentication from the Box authorize endpoint
  and Box will send you an authorization code. You will then send this code
  to this endpoint to exchange it for an access token.

  The returned Access Token can then be used to to make Box API calls.
