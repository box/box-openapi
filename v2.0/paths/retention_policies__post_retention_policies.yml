            description: The name for the retention policy
            example: Some Policy Name

            example: finite
            description: |-
              The type of the retention policy. A retention
              policy type can either be `finite`, where a
              specific amount of time to retain the content is known
              upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time
              to retain the content is still unknown.
            enum:
              - finite
              - indefinite

          disposition_action:
            type: string
            example: permanently_delete
            description: |-
              The disposition action of the retention policy.
              This action can be `permanently_delete`, which
              will cause the content retained by the policy
              to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`,
              which will lift the retention policy from the content,
              allowing it to be deleted by users,
              once the retention policy time period has passed.
            enum:
              - permanently_delete
              - remove_retention

          retention_length:

            description: |-
              The length of the retention policy. This length
              specifies the duration in days that the retention
              policy will be active for after being assigned to
              content.  If the policy has A `policy_type` of
              `indefinite`, the `retention_length` will also be
              `indefinite`.
