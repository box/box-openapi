              Custom configuration for the permissions an admin
              if a group will receive. This option has no effect
              on members with a role of `member`.

              Setting these permissions overwrites the default
              access levels of an admin.

              Specifying a value of "null" for this object will deactivate
              all configurable permissions. Specifying permissions will set
              them accordingly, omitted permissions will be enabled by default.
