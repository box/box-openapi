description: |-
  Defines the **second** attribute by which items
  are sorted.

  The folder type affects the way the items
  are sorted:

    * **Standard folder**:
    Items are always sorted by
    their `type` first, with
    folders listed before files,
    and files listed
    before web links.

    * **Root folder**:
    This parameter is not supported
    for marker-based pagination
    on the root folder

    (the folder with an `id` of `0`).

    * **Shared folder with parent path
    to the associated folder visible to
    the collaborator**:
    Items are always sorted by
    their `type` first, with
    folders listed before files,
    and files listed
    before web links.
