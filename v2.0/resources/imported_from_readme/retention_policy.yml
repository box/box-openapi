  policy_name:
    type: string
    description: The name of the retention policy
  policy_type:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The type of the retention policy. A retention policy type can either be
      `finite`, where a specific amount of time to retain the content is known
      upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time to retain the content
      is still unknown.
  retention_length:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The length of the retention policy. This length specifies the duration in
      days that the retention policy will be active for after being assigned to
      content.  If the policy has `policy_type` of `indefinite`, the
      `retention_length` will also be `indefinite`.
  disposition_action:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The disposition action of the retention policy. This action can be
      `permanently_delete`, which will cause the content retained by the policy
      to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`, which will lift the
      retention policy from the content, allowing it to be deleted by users,
      once the retention policy time period has passed.
  status:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The status of the retention policy. The status of a policy will be
      `active`, unless explicitly retired by an administrator, in which case the

      active again.
