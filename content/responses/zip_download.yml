      The URL that can be used to download the `zip` archive. A `Get` request to
      this URL will start streaming the items requested. By default, this URL

      download is started after which it is valid for the duration of the

      in the archive as well as the number of items already downloaded or
      skipped. By default, this URL is only valid for a few seconds, until the
      `exires_at` time, unless a download is started after which the URL is
      valid for 12 hours from the start of the download.

  name_conflicts:
    type: array
    description: |-
      A list of conflicts that occurred when trying to create the archive. This
      would occur when multiple items have been requested with the
      same name.

      To solve these conflicts, the API will automatically rename an item
      and return a mapping between the original item's name and its new
      name.

      For every conflict, both files will be renamed and therefore this list
      will always be a multiple of 2.
