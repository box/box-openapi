title: Shared link

description: |-
  Shared links provide direct, read-only access to files or folder on Box.

  Shared links with open access level allow anyone with the URL
  to access the item, while shared links with company or collaborators access
  levels can only be accessed by appropriately authenticated Box users.

type: object

properties:
  url:
    type: string
    format: url
    description: |-
      The URL that can be used to access the item on Box.

      This URL will display the item in Box's preview UI where the file
      can be downloaded if allowed.

      This URL will continue to work even when a custom `vanity_url`
      has been set for this shared link.
    example: https://www.box.com/s/vspke7y05sb214wjokpk
    nullable: false

  download_url:
    type: string
    format: url
    x-box-premium-feature: true
    description: |-
      A URL that can be used to download the file. This URL can be used in
      a browser to download the file. This URL includes the file
      extension so that the file will be saved with the right file type.

      This property will be `null` for folders.
    example: https://www.box.com/shared/static/rh935iit6ewrmw0unyul.jpeg
    nullable: true

  vanity_url:

    nullable: true

  vanity_name:

  access:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The access level for this shared link.

      * `open` - provides access to this item to anyone with this link
      * `company` - only provides access to this item to people the same company
      * `collaborators` - only provides access to this item to people who are
         collaborators on this item

      will be set to the default access level specified by the enterprise admin.
    enum:

      - company
      - collaborators
    example: open
    nullable: false

  effective_access:
    type: string
    description: |-

      restrictive access level than the value in the `access` field when the
      enterprise settings restrict the allowed access levels.
    enum:
      - open
      - company
      - collaborators
    example: company
    nullable: false

      by the administrator, the owner, and any ancestor item
      such as a folder.
    enum:
      - can_edit
      - can_download
      - can_preview
      - no_access
    example: can_download
    nullable: false

    example: true
    nullable: false

  permissions:
    type: object
    description: |-
      Defines if this link allows a user to preview, edit, and download an item.
      These permissions refer to the shared link only and
      do not supersede permissions applied to the item it self.
      See effective permission.
    properties:
      can_download:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        nullable: false
        description: |-
          Defines if the shared link allows for the item to be downloaded. For

          set to `open` or `company`, not `collaborators`.

        type: boolean
        example: true
        nullable: false
        description: |-
          Defines if the shared link allows for the item to be previewed.

          This value is always `true`. For shared links on folders this also

        example: false
        nullable: false
        description: |-
          Defines if the shared link allows for the item to be edited.

          This value can only be `true` if `can_download` is also `true` and if
          the item has a type of `file`.

    type: integer
    example: 3
    description: |-
      The number of times this item has been downloaded.
    nullable: false
