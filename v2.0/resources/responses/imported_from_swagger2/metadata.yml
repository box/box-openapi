title: Metadata Object
description: |-
  Metadata can be used for many purposes. Enterprises may want to have a better
  way to organize their digital assets for their marketing teams or developers
  may want to provide advanced content functionality such as facilitating
  workflows or approvals. Metadata is also visible in the Box Web Application.

  Templates

  Metadata that belongs to a file/folder is grouped by templates. Templates
  allow the metadata service to provide a multitude of services, such as
  pre-defining sets of key:value pairs or schema enforcement on specific fields.
  For example, a marketingCollateral template may define where and when specific
  marketing content should be used. You can also see the representation of the
  template in the Box web application while navigating to a file preview.
  Currently, metadata associated with folders does not show in the web
  application.

  Each file/folder can have multiple distinct template instances associated with
  it, such as a marketingCollateral and retentionPolicy template instances.
  Template instances are also grouped by scopes. Currently, the only scopes
  support are enterprise and global. Enterprise scopes are defined on a per
  enterprises basis, whereas global scopes are Box application-wide. Attribute
  order within template instances is not guaranteed.

  Currently, there are four attributes supported by templates: string, enum,
  float, and  date (RFC 3339).


  Global Properties Template

  In addition to enterprise scoped templates, every file on Box has access to
  the global properties template. The Properties template is a bucket of free
  form key:value string pairs, with no additional schema associated with it.
  Properties are ideal for scenarios where applications want to write metadata
  to file objects in a flexible way, without pre-defined template structure.

  Properties follow all the conventions of standard templates, except for being
  located at a different endpoint. All requests made to the properties template
  must be made to /files/{file_id}/metadata/global/properties.
