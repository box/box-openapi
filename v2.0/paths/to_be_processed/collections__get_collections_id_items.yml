summary: Get Collection Items
description: |-
  Retrieves the files and/or folders contained within this collection.
  Collection item lists behave a lot like getting a folderâ€™s items.

  Paginated results can be retrieved using the limit and offset parameters.

  Sub-object fields can be requested via the ?fields parameter
parameters:
  - name: COLLECTION_ID
    in: path
    required: true
    schema:
      type: string
  - name: fields

    in: query
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string
  - name: limit
    description: The maximum number of items to return in a page.
    in: query
    required: false
    schema:
      type: integer
      format: int64
  - name: offset
    description: |-
      The offset at which to begin the response. An offset of value of 0 will
      start at the beginning of the folder-listing. Offset of 2 would start at
      the 2nd record, not the second page. Note: If there are hidden items in
      your previous response, your next offset should be = offset + limit, not
      the # of records you received back.
