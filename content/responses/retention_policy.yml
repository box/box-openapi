  A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
  for a specified amount of time. Admins can create retention
  policies and then later assign them to specific folders
  or their entire enterprise.  To use this feature, you must
  have the manage retention policies scope enabled
  for your API key via your application management console.

          The type of the retention policy. A retention
          policy type can either be `finite`, where a
          specific amount of time to retain the content is known
          upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time
          to retain the content is still unknown.
        enum:
          - finite
          - indefinite

      status:

        example: active
        x-box-field-variant: 2
        description: |-
          The status of the retention policy. The status of
          a policy will be `active`, unless explicitly retired by an
          administrator, in which case the status will be `retired`.
          Once a policy has been retired, it cannot become
          active again.

          - active
