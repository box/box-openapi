tags:

description: |-
  Returns a list of all users for the Enterprise along with their `user_id`,
  `public_name`, and `login`.

  The application and the authenticated user need to
  have the permission to look up users in the entire
  enterprise.

parameters:
  - name: filter_term
    description: |-
      Limits the results to only users who's `name` or
      `login` start with the search term.

      For externally managed users, the search term needs
      to completely match the in order to find the user, and
      it will only return one user at a time.

    required: false

    description: |-
      Limits the results to the kind  of user specified.

      * `all` returns every kind of user for whom the
        `login` or `name` partially matches the
        `filter_term`. It will only return an external user
        if the login matches the `filter_term` completely,
        and in that case it will only return that user.
      * `managed` returns all managed and app users for whom
        the `login` or `name` partially matches the
        `filter_term`.
      * `external` returns all external users for whom the
        `login` matches the `filter_term` exactly.
