description: |-
  Applies an instance of a metadata template to a folder.

  In most cases only values that are present in the metadata template
  will be accepted, except for the `global.properties` template which accepts
  any key-value pair.

  To display the metadata template in the Box web app the enterprise needs to be
  configured to enable **Cascading Folder Level Metadata** for the user in the
  admin console.

            A value for each of the fields that are present on the metadata
            template.

            For the `global.properties` template this can be an a list of zero
            or more fields, as this template allows for any generic key-value
            pairs to be stored on the template.
