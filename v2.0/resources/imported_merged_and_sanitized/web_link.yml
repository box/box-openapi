title: Web Link Object
description: |-
  Web links are objects that point to URLs. These objects
  are also known as

  bookmarks within the Box web application. Web link objects
  are treated

  similarly to file objects, so they will also support
  shared links, copy,

  permanent delete, and restore with the format
  /web_links/{WEB_LINK_ID} in

  place of /files/{FILE_ID}.
