title: Shared link

description: |-
  Shared links provide direct, read-only access to files or folder on Box.

  to access the item, while shared links with company or collaborators access
  levels can only be accessed by appropriately authenticated Box users.

properties:
  url:
    type: string
    format: url
    description: |-
      The URL that can be used to access the item on Box.

      This URL will display the item in Box's preview UI where the file
      can be downloaded if allowed.

      This URL will continue to work even when a custom `vanity_url`
      has been set for this shared link.
    example: https://www.box.com/s/vspke7y05sb214wjokpk
    nullable: false

  download_url:
    type: string
    format: url
    x-box-premium-feature: true
    description: |-
      A URL that can be used to download the file. This URL can be used in
      a browser to download the file. This URL includes the file
      extension so that the file will be saved with the right file type.

      This property will be `null` for folders.
    example: https://www.box.com/shared/static/rh935iit6ewrmw0unyul.jpeg
    nullable: true

    nullable: true

  vanity_name:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The custom name of a shared link, as used in the `vanity_url` field.
    example: my_url
    nullable: true

  access:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The access level for this shared link.

      * `open` - provides access to this item to anyone with this link
      * `company` - only provides access to this item to people the same company
      * `collaborators` - only provides access to this item to people who are
         collaborators on this item

      If this field is omitted when creating the shared link, the access level
      will be set to the default access level specified by the enterprise admin.
    enum:
      - open
      - company
      - collaborators
    example: open
    nullable: false

  effective_access:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The effective access level for the shared link. This can be a more
      restrictive access level than the value in the `access` field when the
      enterprise settings restrict the allowed access levels.
    enum:
      - open
      - company
      - collaborators
    example: company
    nullable: false

  effective_permission:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The effective permissions for this shared link.
      These result in the more restrictive combination of
      the share link permissions and the item permissions set
      by the administrator, the owner, and any ancestor item
      such as a folder.
    enum:
      - can_edit
      - can_download
      - can_preview
      - no_access
    example: can_download
    nullable: false

  unshared_at:
    type: string
    format: date-time
    description: |-
      The date and time when this link will be unshared. This field can only be
      set by users with paid accounts.
    example: "2018-04-13T13:53:23-07:00"
    nullable: true

  is_password_enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |-
      Defines if the shared link requires a password to access the item.
    example: true
    nullable: false

  permissions:
    type: object
    description: |-
      Defines if this link allows a user to preview, edit, and download an item.
      These permissions refer to the shared link only and
      do not supersede permissions applied to the item itself.
    required:
      - can_download
      - can_preview
      - can_edit
    properties:
      can_download:

        example: true
        nullable: false
        description: |-
          Defines if the shared link allows for the item to be downloaded. For
          shared links on folders, this also applies to any items in the folder.

          This value can be set to `true` when the effective access level is
          set to `open` or `company`, not `collaborators`.

      can_preview:
        type: boolean
        example: true
        nullable: false
        description: |-
          Defines if the shared link allows for the item to be previewed.

          This value is always `true`. For shared links on folders this also

        type: boolean
        example: false
        nullable: false
        description: |-
          Defines if the shared link allows for the item to be edited.

          This value can only be `true` if `can_download` is also `true` and if
          the item has a type of `file`.

  download_count:
    type: integer
    example: 3
    description: |-
      The number of times this item has been downloaded.
    nullable: false
