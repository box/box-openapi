          Keeps track of which external source this group is coming from (e.g.
          "Active Directory", "Google Groups", "Facebook Groups").  This should
          be a human-readable identifier up to 255 characters long.  Setting
          this will also prevent Box users from editing this group directly
          through Box.  This is desirable for one-way syncing of groups. Needs
          to be accessed via the fields parameter.
      external_sync_identifier:
        type: string
        description: |-
          An arbitrary identifier that can be used by external group sync tools
          to link this Box Group to an external group.  Example values of this
          field could be an Active Directory Object ID or a Google Group ID.  We
          recommend use of this field in order to avoid issues when group names
          are updated in either Box or external systems. Needs to be accessed
          via the fields parameter.
