  Revert to a previous version of a file.


  If previous versions exist, this method can be used to
  promote one of the older versions to the top of the version history.

  This actually creates a new copy of the old version and puts it at the
  top of the versions history. The file will have the exact same contents
  as the older version, with the the same SHA1/etag, and the same name
  as the original.

  Other properties such as comments do not get updated to their
  former values.
