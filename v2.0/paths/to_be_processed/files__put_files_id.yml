summary: 'Update File Info, Lock and Unlock, Create Shared Link'
description: |-
  Used to update individual or multiple fields in the file object, including
  renaming the file, changing its description, and creating a shared link for
  the file. To move a file, change the ID of its parent folder. An optional
  If-Match header can be included to prevent race conditions.


  To lock and unlock files, you execute a PUT operation on the /files/{file id}
  endpoint and set or clear the lock properties on the file.


  Used to create a shared link for this particular file. Please see here for
  more information on the permissions available for shared links. In order to
  get default shared link status, set it to an empty access level, i.e.
  {"shared_link": {}}. In order to disable a shared link, send this same type of
  PUT request with the value of shared_link set to null, i.e. {"shared_link":
  null}
