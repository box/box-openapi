      schema:

        properties:
          shared_link:
            description: |-
              The settings for the shared link to create on the file.
              Use an empty object (`{}`) to use the default settings for shared
              links.

            type: object
            properties:
              access:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The level of access for the shared link. This can be
                  restricted to anyone with the link (`open`), only people
                  within the company (`company`) and only those who
                  have been invited to the file (`collaborators`).

                  If not set, this field defaults to the access level specified
                  by the enterprise admin. To create a shared link with this
                  default setting pass the `shared_link` object with
                  no `access` field, for example `{ "shared_link": {} }`.

                  The `company` access level is only available to paid
                  accounts.
                enum:
                  - open
                  - company
                  - collaborators
                example: "open"

              password:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  The password required to access the shared link. Set the
                  password to `null` to remove it.

                  A password can only be set when `access` is set to `open`.
                example: "do-not-use-this-password"

              vanity_name:
                type: string
                description: |-
                  Defines a custom vanity name to use in the shared link URL,
                  for example `https://app.box.com/v/my-shared-link`.

                  Custom URLs should not be used when sharing sensitive content
                  as vanity URLs are a lot easier to guess than regular shared
                  links.
                minLength: 12
                example: "my-shared-link"

              unshared_at:
                type: string
                format: date-time
                example: "2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00"
                description: |-
                  The timestamp at which this shared link will
                  expire. This field can only be set by
                  users with paid accounts. The value must be greater than the
                  current date and time.

              permissions:
                type: object
                properties:
                  can_download:
                    type: boolean
                    example: true
                    description: |-
                      If the shared link allows for downloading of files.
                      This can only be set when `access` is set to
                      `open` or `company`.
                  can_preview:
                    type: boolean
                    example: true
                    description: |-
                      If the shared link allows for previewing of files.
                      This value is always `true`. For shared links on folders
                      this also applies to any items in the folder.
                  can_edit:
                    type: boolean
                    example: true
                    description: |-
                      If the shared link allows for editing of files.
                      This can only be set when `access` is set to
                      `open` or `company`.
                      This value can only be `true` is `can_download` is
                      also `true`.
