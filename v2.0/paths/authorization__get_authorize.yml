summary: |-
  Authorize a user

description: |-
  Authorize a user by sending them through the [Box](https://box.com)
  website and request their permission to act on their behalf.

  This is the first step when authenticating a user using
  OAuth 2.0. To request a user's authorization to use the Box APIs
  on their behalf you will need to send a user to the URL with this
  format.

  - name: client_id
    description: |-
      The Client ID of the application that is requesting to authenticate
      the user. To get the Client ID for your application, log in to your
      Box developer console and click the **Edit Application** link for
      the application you're working with. In the OAuth2 Parameters section
      of the configuration page, find the item labeled **client_id**. The
      text of that item is your application's Client ID.

  - name: redirect_uri
    description: |-
      The URL to which Box redirects the browser after the user has granted
      or rejected the application permission. This URL must match the
      redirect URL in the configuration of your application. It must be a
      valid HTTPS URL and it needs to be able to handle the redirection to
      complete the next step in the OAuth2 flow.
    in: query
    example: http://example.com/auth/callback
    required: true
    schema:
      type: string
      format: url

  - name: state
    description: |-
      A custom string of your choice. Box will pass the same string to
      the redirect URL when authentication is complete. This parameter
      can be used to identify a user on redirect, as well as protect
      against hijacked sessions and other attacks.
    in: query
    example: my_state
    required: false
    schema:
      type: string

  - name: scope
    description: |-
      A comma-separated list of application scopes you'd like to
      authenticate the user for. This defaults to all the scopes configured
      for the application in its configuration page.
