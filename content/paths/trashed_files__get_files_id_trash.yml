  Retrieves a file that has been moved to the trash.

  Please note that only if the file itself has been moved to the
  trash can it be retrieved with this API call. If instead one of
  its parent folders was moved to the trash, only that folder
  can be inspected using the
  [`GET /folders/:id/trash`](e://get_folders_id_trash) API.

  To list all items that have been moved to the trash, please
  use the [`GET /folders/trash/items`](e://get-folders-trash-items/)
  API.
