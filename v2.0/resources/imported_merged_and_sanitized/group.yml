  users in some

  operations, such as collaborations.

          Keeps track of which external source this group is
          coming from (e.g.

          "Active Directory", "Google Groups", "Facebook
          Groups").  This should be a

          human-readable identifier up to 255 characters
          long.  Setting this will

          also prevent Box users from editing the group name
          and its members

          directly via the Box web application.  This is
          desirable for one-way

          syncing of groups. Needs to be accessed via the
          `fields` parameter.
      external_sync_identifier:
        type: string
        description: |-
          An arbitrary identifier that can be used by
          external group sync tools to

          link this Box Group to an external group.  Example
          values of this field

          could be an Active Directory Object ID or a Google
          Group ID.  We recommend

          use of this field in order to avoid issues when
          group names are updated in

          either Box or external systems. Needs to be
          accessed via the `fields`

          parameter.
