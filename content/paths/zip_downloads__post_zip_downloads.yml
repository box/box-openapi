  Creates a request to download multiple files and folders as a single `zip`
  archive file. This API does not return the archive but instead performs all
  the checks to ensure that the user has access to all the items, and then
  returns a `download_url` and a `status_url` that can be used to download the
  archive.

  The limit for an archive is either the Account's upload limit or
  10,000 files, whichever is met first.

  **Note**: Downloading a large file can be
  affected by various
  factors such as distance, network latency,
  bandwidth, and congestion, as well as packet loss
  ratio and current server load.
  For these reasons we recommend that a maximum ZIP archive
  total size does not exceed 25GB.

      If the `zip` archive is ready to be downloaded, the API will return a
      response that will include a `download_url`, a `status_url`, as well as
      any conflicts that might have occurred when creating the request.

      Returns an error if some of the parameters are missing or
      not valid.

      In most cases, this error might happen because the JSON request body is
      not valid JSON, any of the items has an incorrect or missing ID, any of
      the items is not a file or folder, or the root folder with ID `0` has been
      added to the list of folders to add to the archive.

      The following is a list of common error codes for this response.

      * `bad_request` - the request body is missing, invalid, or both the list
      of files and folders are empty. Additionally, it this error might be
      returned when attempting to add the root folder with ID `0` to an archive.
      * `zip_download_file_count_exceeded_limit` - the requested files and
      folders would result in an archive with more than 10,000 files. The
      request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce the number
      of files per archive.
      * `zip_download_pre_compressed_bytes_exceeded_limit` - the requested files
      and folders would result in an archive with more than the allowed download
      limit. The request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce
      the size of the archive.
