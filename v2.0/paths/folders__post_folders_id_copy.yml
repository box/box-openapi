summary: Copy a folder

x-box-enable-explorer: true
x-box-reference-category: folders

description: |-
  Creates a copy of a folder within a destination folder.

  The original folder will not be changed.

  # Asynchronous copying

  If the folder being copied contains up to 500 items the copy will
  happen synchronously with the API call. The call will not return until
  the copy operation has completed.

  If the folder contains more than 500 items the copy operation will be
  executed asynchronously and the API call will return directly yet before
  the copy operation has completed. We currently have no API to check when
  a copy operation has finished.

  # Folder locking

  During this operation, part of the file tree will be locked, mainly
  the source folder and all of its descendants, as well as the destination
  folder.

  For the duration of the operation, no other move, copy, delete, or restore
  operation can performed on any of the locked folders. Most importantly, this
  means that the same folder can not be copied to two different parts of the
  folder tree at the same time.

  # Metadata

  If the destination folder has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of the
  parent folders a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off asynchronously.

  We currently have no API to check when this operation has finished.

parameters:
  - name: folder_id
    description: |-
      The unique identifier of the folder to copy.

      The ID for any folder can be determined
      by visiting this folder in the web application
      and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
      for the url `https://*.app.box.com/folder/123`
      the `folder_id` is `123`.

      The root folder with the ID `0` can not be copied.
    example: "0"
    in: path
    required: true
    schema:
      type: string
      nullable: false

              An optional new name for the copied folder.

              There are some restrictions to the file name. Names containing
              non-printable ASCII characters, forward and backward slashes
              (`/`, `\`), as well as names with trailing spaces are
              prohibited.

              Additionally, the special names `.` and `..` are
              not allowed either.
