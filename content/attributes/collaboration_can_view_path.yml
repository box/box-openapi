  Determines if the invited users can see the entire parent path to
  the associated folder. The user will not gain privileges in any
  parent folder and therefore can not see content the user is not

  invitee's **All Files** page. We recommend you limit the number of collaborations
  with `can_view_path` enabled to 1,000 per user.
