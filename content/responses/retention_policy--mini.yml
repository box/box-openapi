        description: |-
          The disposition action of the retention policy.
          This action can be `permanently_delete`, which
          will cause the content retained by the policy
          to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`,
          which will lift the retention policy from the content,
          allowing it to be deleted by users,
          once the retention policy has expired.
