operationId: post_folders_id_copy

summary: Copy a folder

description: |-
  Creates a copy of a folder within a destination folder.

  The original folder will not be changed.

  During this operation, part of the file tree will be locked, mainly
  the source folder and all of its descendants, as well as the destination
  folder.

  For the duration of the operation, no other move, copy, delete, or restore
  operation can performed on any of the locked folders. Most importantly, this
  means that the same folder can not be copied to two different parts of the
  folder tree at the same time.
