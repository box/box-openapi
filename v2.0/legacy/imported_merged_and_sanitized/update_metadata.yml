        The path that designates the key, in the format of a
        JSON-Pointer. Since

        all keys are located at the root of the metadata
        instance, the key must

        be prefixed with a /. Special characters ~ and / in
        the key must be

        escaped according to JSON-Pointer specification. The
        value at the path

        must exist for the operation to be successful.
    value:
      type: string
      description: |-
        The value to be set or tested. Required for add,
        replace, and test

        operations. For add, if value already exists, then
        previous value will

        be overwritten by the new value. For replace, the
        metadata value must

        exist before replacing.For test, the value of the
        existing metadata

        instance must match the specified value.

        Required for move or copy. The path that designates
        the source key, in

        the format of a JSON-Pointer, formatted in the same
        way as path. Used in

        conjunction with path: from specifies the source,
        path specifies the

        destination.
example:
  - op: replace
    path: /test
    value: changedvalue
