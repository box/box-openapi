  A file representation

properties:
  content:
    type: object
    description: |-
      An object containing the URL that can be used to actually fetch
      the representation.
    properties:
      url_template:
        type: string
        example: |-
          https://dl.boxcloud.com/api/2.0/internal_files/123/versions/345/representations/png_paged_2048x2048/content/{+asset_path}?watermark_content=4567
        description: |-
          The download URL that can be used to fetch the representation.
          Make sure to make an authenticated API call to this endpoint.

          This URL is a template and will require the `{+asset_path}` to
          be replaced by a path. In general, for un-paged representations
          it can be replaced by an empty string.

          For paged representations, replace the `{+asset_path}` with the
          page to request plus the extension for the file, for example
          `1.pdf`.

          When requesting the download URL the following additional
          query params can be passed along.

          * `set_content_disposition_type` - Sets the `Content-Disposition`
            header in the API response with the specified disposition type
            of either `inline` or `attachment`. If not supplied, the
            `Content-Disposition` header is not included in the response.

          * `set_content_disposition_filename` - Allows the application to
            define the representation's file name used in the
            `Content-Disposition` header.  If not defined, the filename
            is derived from the source file name in Box combined with the
            extension of the representation.

          * `pending` defines the representation as to be generated. Retry
            this endpoint to re-check the status.
          * `none` defines that the representation will be created when
            requested. Request the URL defined in the `info` object to trigger
            this generation.
