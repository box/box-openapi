title: Retention Policy Object
description: |-
  A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
  for a specified amount of time. Admins can create retention
  policies and then later assign them to specific folders
  or their entire enterprise.  To use this feature, you must
  have the manage retention policies scope enabled
  for your API key via your application management console.

      policy_type:
        type: string
        example: finite
        description: |-
          The type of the retention policy. A retention
          policy type can either be `finite`, where a
          specific amount of time to retain the content is known
          upfront, or `indefinite`, where the amount of time
          to retain the content is still unknown.
        enum:
          - finite
          - indefinite

      retention_length:
        type: string
        format: int32
        example: "0"
        description: |-
          The length of the retention policy. This length
          specifies the duration in days that the retention
          policy will be active for after being assigned to
          content.  If the policy has A `policy_type` of
          `indefinite`, the `retention_length` will also be
          `indefinite`.

      disposition_action:
        type: string
        example: permanently_delete
        description: |-
          The disposition action of the retention policy.
          This action can be `permanently_delete`, which
          will cause the content retained by the policy
          to be permanently deleted, or `remove_retention`,
          which will lift the retention policy from the content,
          allowing it to be deleted by users,
          once the retention policy time period has passed.
        enum:
          - permanently_delete
          - remove_retention

      status:
        type: string
        example: active
        description: |-
          The status of the retention policy. The status of
          a policy will be `active`, unless explicitly retired by an
          administrator, in which case the status will be `retired`.
          Once a policy has been retired, it cannot become
          active again.
        enum:
          - active
          - retired
