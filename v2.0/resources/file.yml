        type: object
        description: |-
          A list of key-value pairs of metadata objects within their
          scopes.

          To access the metadata for a file, first use the
          Metadata-endpoints to determine
          the metadata templates available to your enterprise.

          Then use the `GET /files/:id` endpoint with
          the `fields` query parameter to get the metadata by ID.

          The ID for a metadata template will be in the format
          `metadata.<scope>.<templatename>`, for example
          `metadata.global.properties`.

        example:
          global:
            marketingCollateral:
              $canEdit: true
              $id: 01234500-12f1-1234-aa12-b1d234cb567e

              A list of representations for a file that can be used to
              display a placeholder of the file in your application. By default
              this returns all representations and we recommend using the
              `X-Rep-Hints` header to further customize the desired
              representations.
