description: |-
  Creates a new metadata cascade policy that applies a given
  metadata template to a given folder and automatically
  cascades it down to any files within that folder.

  In order for the policy to be applied a metadata instance must first
  be applied to the folder the policy is to be applied to.

requestBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        type: object
        required:
          - folder_id
          - scope
          - templateKey
        properties:
          folder_id:
            type: string
            description: |-
              The ID of the folder to apply the policy to. This folder will
              need to already have an instance of the targeted metadata
              template applied to it.
            example: "1234567"

          scope:
            description: |-
              The scope of the targeted metadata template. This template will
              need to already have an instance applied to the targeted folder.
            example: "enterprise"
            type: string
            enum:
              - global
              - enterprise

          templateKey:
            type: string
            example: productInfo
            description: |-
              The key of the targeted metadata template. This template will
              need to already have an instance applied to the targeted folder.

              In many cases the template key is automatically derived
              of its display name, for example `Contract Template` would
              become `contractTemplate`. In some cases the creator of the
              template will have provided its own template key.

              Please [list the templates for an enterprise][list], or
              get all instances on a [file][file] or [folder][folder]
              to inspect a template's key.
