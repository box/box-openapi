summary: Promote Version
description: |-
  If there are previous versions of this file, this method can be used to
  promote one of the older versions to the top of the stack. This actually mints
  a copy of the old version and puts it on the top of the versions stack. The
  file will have the exact same contents, the same SHA1/etag, and the same name
  as the original. Other properties such as comments do not get updated to their
  former values.
