              Keeps track of which external source this group is
              coming, for example `Active Directory`, or `Okta`.

              Setting this will also prevent Box admins from editing
              the group name and its members directly via the Box
              web application.

              This is desirable for one-way syncing of groups.

          external_sync_identifier:
            type: string
            description: |-
              An arbitrary identifier that can be used by
              external group sync tools to link this Box Group to
              an external group.

              Example values of this field
              could be an **Active Directory Object ID** or a **Google
              Group ID**.

              We recommend you use of this field in
              order to avoid issues when group names are updated in
              either Box or external systems.
