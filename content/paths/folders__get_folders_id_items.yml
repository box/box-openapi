  Retrieves a page of items in a folder. These items can be files,
  folders, and web links.

  To request more information about the folder itself, like its size,
  please use the [Get a folder](#get-folders-id) endpoint instead.

parameters:
  - $ref: '../attributes/folder_id.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/fields--with_metadata.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/usemarker.yml'
  - $ref: '../attributes/marker.yml'

  - name: sort
    description: |-
      Defines the **second** attribute by which items
      are sorted.

      Items are always sorted by their `type` first, with
      folders listed before files, and files listed
      before web links.

      This parameter is not supported for marker-based pagination
      on the root folder (the folder with an ID of `0`).
